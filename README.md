## Type of works handled 
- ***Operations :*** Managed multiple clients for BAU operaitons as a second line manager of around 20 resources.
- ***Transitions :*** Being part of the Central team worked for many new clients for taking transition from other old vendors and streamlining the operations till handover to BAU teams.
- ***Transformation :*** For New/Existing customers worked for the Transformation projects like Asset refresh , DC movements ( onprem to onprem) , moving from onprem to Cloud , New Environment builds etc. 
- ***Automation :*** Automating as per need of customer means not only by using the available devops/automation tools but also by developing customised solutions for customers based on their specific needs.
- ***Development :*** I work for automation using diffirent languages : Bash , python , php etc
- ***Orchestration :*** I worked on orchestrator like Cloudify to automate the infra as code by developing the blueprints which can cater the infra integrations with multiple components for example for new servers provisioning.

## A Few Recent works handled 

- Optimized VM provisioning time from 1–2 days to under 1 hour by automating Linux/Windows lifecycle with Cloudify blueprints (like terraform IaC), with full infra integration, and post-provisioning orchestration.
- Built self-service network provisioning portals enabling one-click subnet, security zone, Infoblox, and firewall object management via REST APIs; backend in Django/Flask, frontend in Vue/React & OpenAPI for REST APIs, integrated with NDO, Infoblox, Panorama, and APIC.
- Migration from monolithic app running on VM to Kubernetes microservices. For one application used for Network components management hosted on VM environment where it was a one large monolithic application having all components stitched together. I architected its cloud native design and then migrated this to a high availability Kubernetes cluster end to end. Including setup of Kubernetes cluster, design of application microservices, building container images for small microservices in distributed manner, having stateful set for databases and different deployments for components like GrayLog, Elasticsearch, flask application etc.
- Designed and implemented multi-cloud infrastructure across AWS, GCP, and Azure, leveraging compute, storage, networking, identity, and monitoring services to deliver highly available, secure, and cost-optimized environments with automated scaling and resilience.
- Deployed full-stack patch management solution for Linux servers using Ansible (dynamic CMDB inventory) and Django dashboards for reporting and scheduling.
- Developed Ansible roles for RedHat CIS compliance, delivering tailored security hardening and automated compliance reporting with Python and JavaScript.
- Automated Linux health checks and metrics collection with python, shell scripts and Ansible, storing results in MySQL for real-time dashboards via Django.
- Engineered CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins (Groovy) and Git-based config control; implemented GitLab runners for automated testing and deployments.
- Implemented structured Git branching strategy with pull request approvals, ensuring controlled code integration, peer reviews, and streamlined collaboration across distributed teams.
- Orchestration of full application lifecycle management using Docker, Podman, and Kubernetes across both self-managed and managed clusters (on-prem and cloud: GKE, EKS, AKS), ensuring scalability, resilience, and streamlined deployments.
- Built internal tools like Linux Management Consoles, Network Dashboards, Billing and invoicing dashboards and Security Compliance Portals.
- Designed and administered MariaDB, MongoDB databases for automation platforms.
- Lead asset refresh and data center migration projects involving on-prem and cloud transitions.
- Delivered client-specific customized automation solutions using scripting, APIs, and orchestration tools.

## Personal Note 
- I have been working in IT from 2005 and have seen things emerging and changing rapidly with adapting myself with their pace. In the beginning, I had the chance to work at the root level, as low as desktop support to intranet development for small organizations, then moving on to managing Superdome HPUX servers, installing C7000 chassis, network components, and cabling in Datacenters. I also managed operations teams supporting multiple global clients and later worked in an engineering team providing solutions to escalated problems in the HP Solution Center. Over the years, I have seen operations teams struggling with repetitive work, and I managed to streamline this by providing customized dashboards and automation tailored to specific needs. Because I have worked across different infrastructure domains like Linux, network, backups, storage, and databases, I developed the ability to understand the pain areas and design solutions for them. And not only designing them, but I am also very good at hands-on implementing them.
- The recent changes in my experience include orchestration of complete workflows for VM provisioning, integrating different domains end to end. With this wide range of experience, I feel I can be utilized for almost any work related to infrastructure. When I say INFRA, I mean that I do not do core business application development in Java or SAP, but I am absolutely a developer when it comes to infrastructure management related applications. I have worked on development of applications like NMC (for managing network components across enterprise environments) and LMC (which takes care of most of the tasks related to Linux servers’ management). I am well versed with development practices like Git and branching strategies, and I work with a DevOps mindset pipelining tasks, using Jenkins, and working with code to manage infra in an IaC culture.
- Being privileged to be part of the central team in HCL gave me exposure to work with quite a number of global clients for all sorts of different requirements all time so I worked most of time on public clouds and the cloud-native world. Using Kubernetes on on prem clusters or public cloud hardly makes a difference when we use Terraform to manage pods and deployments. The same goes for VMs whether they are on-prem, AWS, or GCP it doesn’t make a big difference, and fortunately, I have worked on AWS and Google Cloud for setting up infrastructure as well. I also know very well the benefits of hybrid clouds and how to leverage them alongside private clouds.
- There is a lot more to say about what I have learned and worked on in the last 20+ years, but I end with a simple note: in IT, if I have done something before, I can do it in less time with better focus but if it is something I am doing for the first time, I can learn it and do it may be little extra time. That is how I keep moving. So, if the work is related to infrastructure, DevOps, or automation, I am the best fit for any automation, development, management, security auditing, troubleshooting or architecture related work. I am also very good at application development for infrastructure, but core business application development in Java or other languages is not my interest.
